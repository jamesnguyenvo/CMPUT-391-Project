From the data seen in the table, we can conclude that R-tree is the most appropriate method for indexing spatial data. In the table it can be seen that the R-tree is significantly faster throughout all tests, with the fastest R-tree query having taken 0.000122 seconds vs the fastest B+ Tree query taking 0.0118 seconds. Not only was the R-tree faster, but it was also more consistent. It has a range of 0.000237 seconds in difference between the fastest and slowest time, vs. the B+ Tree having a range of 0.07368 seconds. The difference in speed between the two access methods may largely be attributed to the difference in how they cluster data. The B+ tree only clusters unidimensionally, which makes them ineffcient for area queries, while R-Trees cluster nodes by proximity, including all applicable dimensions stored. This makes area queries much more efficient, as they essentially result in range queries based upon MBR. Therefore, we conclude that it is the multidimensional clustering that makes R-trees more effcient relative to B+ trees when working with spatial data.
